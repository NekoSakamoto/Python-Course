# the hash makes this line a single line coment, you can write anything because python will ignore what will be under this line
''' this is a multi line comment it does the same thing like single line comment
but it can comment multiple lines like this '''
# print("Print fuction is used to print something") 
# from here its practice
''' print("""Twinkle, twinkle, little star
How I wonder what you are
Up above the world so high
Like a diamond in the sky
Twinkle, twinkle little star
How I wonder what you are
When the blazing sun is gone
When he nothing shines upon
Then you show your little light
Twinkle, twinkle, all the night
Twinkle, twinkle, little star
How I wonder what you are""") '''# """ three quotes like this can print multiple lines (amazing not kidding)
# lets import a module and run it 
# from playsound import playsound
# lets run/use it!
# playsound ('/home/nekosamadesu/Downloads/Python Course with Notes/1. Chapter 1/play.mp3') 
# i have commented this command because the music is too annoying and it doesnt stop like for the whole 4 minutes... ihate the song but it works!
'''import os 
print(os.listdir())''' # these two commands are just simply used to show the files of a directory where you currently are
