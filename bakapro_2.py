# right now the topic is about variables. not so scary if learned properly 
# name = "Talha" # name and passwords are a variable.
# password = "neko"
# lets make a program that tells you your password if you type "What is my password?"
# input("What can I help you with? ",)
# print(name +  " your password is:" + password)
# congractulations it works!!
# programming is one heck of a brain eater not gonna lie 
# a = "baka" well this a var contains baka but when i print it with print(a) it will show baka, the problem is i want "baka" so 
# what should i do? simply put three quotes and two quotes inside like this '''"baka"''' and lets try again!
# a = '''"baka"'''
# print(a) congrats it works!!

# lets try a multi line var
# you='''you
# are a 
# sussy 
# baka
# and i know 
# this is kringe 
# but please 
# bear with me.'''
# print(you) and yeah it works!!

# now lets tackle datatypes 
# following are the datatypes:
# Integers = normal numbers like 1,2,3 and e.t.c.
# String = anything like this "Baka" "i returned home late" "today is jan 20 and its 19:03 right now"
# Floating point-numbers = these are numbers like 3.8, 5.2, 9.0 and e.t.c.
# Booleans = they represent if something is true or false like d= False or d= True 
# None = it means and represents 'nothing' in python language. like if you type f= None it will print None
# how to see/identify a var's type?
# a = "Baka"
# b = 90
# c = 3.8
# d = True 
# e = False
# f = None
# #now how to identify their types? do this
# print(type(a))
# print(type(b))
# print(type(c))
# print(type(d))
# print(type(e))
# print(type(f)) and yea thats the way to show its types

# now comes the topic of operators 
# following are operators 
# Arithmetic operators = +,-,* and /
# Assignment operators = =,+=.-= e.t.c.
# Comparision operators = ==,>,>=,<,!= 
# Logical operators = and, or, not

# first lets talk about arithmetic operators
# Arithmetic Operators

# a = 3
# b = 4
# print("4+3 is equal to", 4+3)
# print("4-3 is equal to", 4-3)
# print("4*3 is equal to", 4*3)
# print("4/3 is equal to", 4/3)
# Assignment Operators

# a = 34 if theres a value like this and i want to perform addition on it without disturbing the acutal 34
# a += 2 to add we'll just use this assignment operator to add more value to tha var
# print (a) now it will give 36
# now the following do the same thing of changing the value
# a = 34
# a -= 12
# a = 34
# a *= 2
# a = 34
# a /= 2
# print(a)

# Comparison Operators 
# a = (14>7) # now this is a comparison operator used to see greater than, < is used for less than
# # if we print a it will tell that is 14 greater than 7 with true or false if greater true if not then false means it'll return a boolean
# print (a)
# a = (14>7)
# a = (14<7)
# a = (14==7)
# a = (14>=7)
# a = (14<=7)
# a = (14!=7) != means not equal while == means equal

# Logical Operators
# bool1 = True 
# bool2 = False
# print ("The value of bool1 and bool2 is", (bool1 and bool2)) and will find if both of them are true if not it will return false
# print ("The value of bool1 or bool2 is", (bool1 or bool2)) or will find a true if even one of these is true it will return true
# print ("The value of not bool2 is", (not bool2)) not reverses what is put inside it like bool2 is false it will return as true

#  Typecasting
# a = "5" # now this is a string not a integer because double qoutes are put but now i want to change it to integer bc i want to add more value
# a = int(a) # this converts it into a integer but only number strings can be converted into integers not strings like "Baka"
# print(a+5) # now if what we did was without any mistake than it will give 10 as the answer.
# Typecasting is just to change one data type to another like to a hindu to Muslim

# Input
# name = input("Enter your name: ") Input function is used to take input like shown here.
# print("Hello", name)

# Practice set
# print ("Enter your number: ")
# n1 = input()
# print ("Enter your second number")
# n2 = input()
# print ("Your answer is ", int(n1) + int(n2))
# a= 50
# b= 40
# print ("The answer is ", a+b)
# a= 4
# b= 2
# print ("The remainder of dividing 4 by 2 is", 4%2)
# a= "5"
# inku = input()
# print (type(a))
# inku2 = input()
# a= int(a)
# a + 4
# print (type(a))
# a= 50
# b= 34
# print (a>b)
# n1= input("Enter your first number: ")
# n2= input("Enter your second number: ")
# avg = (int(n1) + int(n2))/2
# print ("The average of n1 and n2 is", avg)
# n1= input("Enter your number: ")
# n1 =int(n1)
# print ("The answer is", n1*n1)
# Username=input("Enter your name: ")
# a=len(Username)

# if a<10:
#     print("less than 10 characters")
# elif'''10''':
#     print("Congrats you found a eagsteregg!")
# else:
#     print("more than 10 characters")

# The chapter 2 ends here -_-
